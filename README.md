## Explainer: Layout Instability Metric

### Overview

Many websites suffer from **layout instability** - DOM elements shifting around
due to content loading asynchronously.

We propose a way for the user agent to measure layout instability during a
browsing session to compute "layout shift scores", which would be exposed by a
new interface in the
[Performance API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API).

### Layout Shift Score

Each animation frame (a.k.a.
"[rendering update](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#update-the-rendering)")
computes a **layout shift (LS) score** approximating the severity of visible
layout instability in the document during that frame.  An animation frame with
no layout instability has an LS score of 0.  Higher LS scores correspond to
greater instability.

The LS score is based on a set of [shifting elements](#Shifting-Elements) and two
intermediate values, the [impact fraction](#Impact-Fraction) and the
[distance fraction](#Distance-Fraction).

### Shifting Elements

A **shifting element** is one whose visual representation starts in a
significantly different location than it did in the previous animation frame
(for a reason other than [transform change](#Transform-Changes)).
"Starts" refers here to the element's
[flow-relative](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#flow-relative) offset
in the document.

The visual representation of a block-level element is its
[border box](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-box-3/#border-box).  The visual
representation of an inline element is the geometric union of its
[box fragments](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-break-3/#box-fragment), the first of
which determines its starting location.

Note that:

* An element that changes in size (for example, by having children appended),
  but starts at the same offset, is not a shifting element.

* An element whose start location changes two or more times during the same
  animation frame (for example, from
  [forced synchronous layouts](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/avoid-large-complex-layouts-and-layout-thrashing#avoid_forced_synchronous_layouts)),
  but is ultimately painted at the same location as the previous frame, is not
  a shifting element.

* An element whose start location changes by less than 3 CSS pixels is not a
  shifting element.  This threshold was chosen to avoid penalizing trivial
  movements.  It also allows some animations (but a broader allowance is
  described in "Transform Changes" below).

### Transform Changes

Changing an element's [transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)
affects its visual representation.  However, because

* transform changes don't reflow surrounding content,
* transform changes are a common target of fluid animations, and
* animated transform changes are easily rendered with hardware-accelerated
  compositing on a separate thread from the browser's layout and script
  execution tasks,

the layout instability metric doesn't treat transform-changing elements, or
their descendants, as shifting elements (unless their layout is affected in some
other way at the same time).

### Impact Fraction

The **impact region** of an animation frame is the geometric union of the
previous-frame and current-frame visual representations, intersected with the
viewport, of all shifting elements in that frame.

The **impact fraction** of an animation frame is the fraction of the viewport that
is occupied by the impact region.

![Illustration of a shifting element on a device, with the impact region
highlighted](https://i.imgur.com/XN7xdKF.png)

*Example: An element which occupies half the viewport shifts by a distance equal
to half its height.  The impact fraction for this animation frame is 0.75.*

### Distance Fraction

The **move distance** of a shifting element is the distance it has moved on
the horizontal or vertical axis (whichever is greater).

The **distance fraction** of an animation frame is the greatest move distance
of any shifting element in that frame, divided by the width or height
(whichever is greater) of the viewport.

![Illustration of shifting elements on a device, with their move distances
indicated by arrows](https://i.imgur.com/qeks8UK.png)

*Example: The most-shifted element moved a distance of one quarter of the
viewport.  The distance fraction for this animation frame is 0.25.*

The intent of incorporating the distance fraction into the LS score calculation
is to avoid overly penalizing cases where large elements shift by small
distances.

### LS Score Calculation

The layout shift (LS) score is equal to the impact fraction multiplied by the
distance fraction.

The user agent may trade off precision for efficiency in the computation of
LS scores.  It is intended that the LS score have a correspondence to the
perceptual severity of the instability, but not that all user agents produce
exactly the same LS scores for a given page.

### Performance API

Animation frames with non-zero LS scores will notify a registered
[PerformanceObserver](https://w3c.github.io/performance-timeline/#the-performanceobserver-interface).
The observer's callback receives one or more `LayoutShift` entries:

```idl
interface LayoutShift : PerformanceEntry {
    double value;
    boolean hadRecentInput;
    DOMHighResTimeStamp lastInputTime;
};
```

The entry's `value` attribute is the LS score.  Its
[entryType](https://w3c.github.io/performance-timeline/#dom-performanceentry-entrytype)
attribute is `"layout-shift"`.

The `hadRecentInput` and `lastInputTime` attributes are described in
[Recent Input Exclusion](#Recent-Input-Exclusion).

### Cumulative Scores

The user agent can compute a **document cumulative layout shift** (DCLS) score
as the sum of the document's LS scores for each animation frame that has occurred
during the browsing session.  The DCLS score is 0 when the document begins
loading, and grows whenever layout instability occurs.  The DCLS score does not
account for layout instability inside descendant browsing contexts, such as
those created by `<iframe>` elements.

The user agent can compute a **cumulative layout shift** (CLS) score for a
[top-level browsing context](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#top-level-browsing-context)
by summing the LS scores of the top-level browsing context to the weighted LS
scores of its descendant browsing contexts.  In performing this aggregation,
the LS score of a layout shift in an `<iframe>` should be weighted by the
fraction of the top-level viewport the `<iframe>` occupies at the time the
layout shift occurs.

The DCLS and CLS scores are not directly exposed by the [Performance API](#Performance-API),
but we hope to make it easy for developers to construct these from the LS scores.

### Recent Input Exclusion

In calculating DCLS and CLS scores, developers and user agents may wish to
exclude LS scores from animation frames that occur after recent
[UI events](https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents/) events such as taps, key presses,
and mouse clicks.  This allows the page to modify its layout in response to
the event.

To facilitate this exclusion, the `LayoutShift` entry has attributes
indicating when such input last occurred, and whether it should be considered
"recent" for the purpose of the exclusion.

The `hadRecentInput` attribute is `true` when the last input occurred within
the past 500 ms.  It should be treated as a hint to ignore the layout shift in
calculating the DCLS and CLS scores.  This threshold was chosen to allow the
page to make asynchronous rendering updates as a result of the input, as long
as they occur without excessive delay. Developers wishing to implement a
different threshold can do so by examining the `lastInputTime`.

Events caused by pointer movement or scrolling do not count as "input" for the
purpose of the recent input exclusion and the input-related attributes on the
`LayoutShift` entry.

### Computing DCLS with the API

The developer can compute the DCLS score by summing the LS scores:

```javascript
addEventListener("load", () => {
    let DCLS = 0;
    new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
        list.getEntries().forEach((entry) => {
            if (entry.hadRecentInput)
                return;  // Ignore shifts after recent input.
            DCLS += entry.value;
        });
    }).observe({type: "layout-shift", buffered: true});
});
```

By passing `buffered: true` to
[observe](https://w3c.github.io/performance-timeline/#dom-performanceobserver-observe),
the observer is immediately notified of any layout shifts that occurred before
it was registered.  (Layout shift entries are *not* available from the
[Performance Timeline](https://w3c.github.io/performance-timeline/#performance-timeline)
through `getEntriesByType`.)

A "final" DCLS score for the user's session can be reported by listening to the
[visibilitychange event](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/07/page-lifecycle-api#event-visibilitychange),
and using the value of `DCLS` at that time.

A [demo page](https://output.jsbin.com/zajamil/quiet) illustrating the use of this
code can be viewed in Chrome 76+ with the command-line flag
`--enable-blink-features=LayoutInstabilityAPI`, or in Chrome 73-75 with the
command-line flag `--enable-blink-features=LayoutJankAPI`.

### Limitations

The Layout Instability API can perform poorly in certain scenarios:

* Layout-inducing animations are penalized by the API, which means that some carousels could contribute to the CLS score of a website.

* While the API tries to use heuristics for animations and user input, those heuristics won't work well for every website.

### Privacy and Security

Layout instability bears an indirect relationship to resource timing, as slow
resources could cause intermediate layouts that would not otherwise be
performed.  Resource timing information can be used by malicious websites for
statistical fingerprinting.

The layout instability API only reports layout shifts in the current browsing
context (frame).  It does not directly provide the CLS score incorporating
subframes.  Developers can implement such aggregation manually, but browsing
contexts with different
[origins](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/origin.html#concept-origin)
would need to cooperate to share LS scores.

### Terminology

The "layout instability metric" was previously called the "layout stability
metric".

"Layout instability" and "layout shift" were previously referred to as
"layout jank".  The impact region was previously referred to as the "jank
region".  The LS score was previously referred to as the "jank fraction".

The DCLS score and CLS score were previously referred to as
"(aggregate) jank score".

The LayoutShift interface was previously implemented as PerformanceLayoutJank.
Its "value" attribute was previously named "fraction", and its entryType was
previously "layoutJank".

The layout instability API is an extension of the web performance API, but it is
not related to the speed or timing of layout computation.
